40183482,EXPRESS: Pediatric AML Prognostication with an m6A-Focused Lasso Model.,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research (J Investig Med),"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents varying prognoses in pediatric and adult patients, with
dysregulated m6A-related genes playing a pivotal role in its pathogenesis. Through an analysis of
single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus, we uncovered distinct patterns of
m6A gene expression specific to pediatric AML cases. Additionally, we devised a Lasso risk
regression model to evaluate prognosis within different AML subsets, showcasing the clinical utility
of m6A-related genes in predicting AML outcomes. Our study underscores the unique and significant
m6A gene expression profiles observed in pediatric AML, emphasizing their potential relevance in
prognostic assessment. The demonstrated effectiveness of the Lasso risk regression model further
underscores the importance of m6A-related genes as valuable predictors of AML outcomes. These
findings not only unveil novel insights into the prognostic implications of m6A-related genes in
pediatric AML but also advocate for their application as prognostic markers to enhance personalized
treatment strategies in both pediatric and adult AML populations.",Hematologic Diseases
40232841,Precision screening facilitates clinical classification of BRCA2-PALB2 binding variants with benign and pathogenic functional effects.,The Journal of clinical investigation (J Clin Invest),"Decoding the clinical impact of genetic variants is particularly important for precision medicine in
cancer. Genetic screening of mainly breast and ovarian cancer patients has identified numerous
BRCA1/BRCA2 'variants of uncertain significance' (VUS) that remain unclassified due to a lack of
pedigrees and functional data.  Here, we used CRISPR-Select - a technology that exploits unique
inbuilt controls at the endogenous locus - to assess 54 rare ClinVar VUS located in the
PALB2-binding domain (PBD) of BRCA2. Variant deleteriousness was examined in the absence and
presence of PARPi, Cisplatin, or Mitomycin C.  Marked functional deficiency was observed for
variants in the exon 2-donor splice region (A22 = (c.66A>C), A22 = (c.66A>G), A22 = (c.66A>T), and
D23H) and Trp31 amino acid (W31G, W31L, and W31C), both critical for BRCA2 function. Moreover, T10K
and G25R resulted in an intermediate phenotype, suggesting these variants are hypomorphic in nature.
Combining our functional results with the latest ClinGen BRCA1/2 Variant Curation Expert Panel
recommendations, we could classify 49 of the 54 VUS as either likely benign (n = 45) or likely
pathogenic (n = 4).  Hence, CRISPR-Select is an important tool for efficient variant clinical
classification. Application of this technology in the future will ultimately improve patient care.

40157909,A novel clinically relevant antagonistic interplay between prolactin and oncogenic YAP-CCN2 pathways as a differentiation therapeutic target in breast cancer.,Cell death & disease (Cell Death Dis),"Cellular differentiation limits cellular plasticity allowing cells to attain their specialized
functional characteristics and phenotypes, whereas loss of differentiation is a hallmark of cancer.
Thus, characterizing mechanisms underlying differentiation is key to discover new cancer
therapeutics. We report a novel functional antagonistic relationship between the prolactin
(PRL)/prolactin receptor (PRLR) differentiation pathway and YAP-CCN2 oncogenic pathway in normal
mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells that is essential for establishing/maintaining
acinar morphogenesis, cell-cell junctions and the intracellular localization of apical-basal
polarity protein complexes (Par, Crumb and Scrib). Importantly, using CRISPR knockout of the PRLR in
MCF7, HR+ breast cancer cells, further revealed that the negative relationship between PRL/PRLR
pathway and YAP-CCN2 pathway is critical in suppressing luminal-to-basal stem-like lineage
plasticity. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of this interplay was evaluated using bioinformatics
approaches on several human datasets, including samples from normal breast epithelium, breast
cancer, and 33 other cancer types. This analysis revealed a positive correlation between PRLR and
the YAP suppressor Hippo pathway and a co-expression gene network driving favourable patients'
survival outcomes in breast cancer. The therapeutic potential of this interplay was also evaluated
in vitro using MDA-MB-231 cells, a preclinical model of human triple-negative breast cancer, where
treatment with PRL and Verteporfin, an FDA-approved pharmacological YAP-inhibitor, alone or their
combination suppressed the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the stem cell marker
CD44 as well as reduced their Ki67 proliferative marker expression. Collectively, our results
emphasize the pro-differentiation role of PRL/PRLR pathway in mammary and breast cancer cells and
highlight that promoting PRL/PRLR signaling while inhibiting the YAP-CCN2 oncogenic pathway can be
exploited as a differentiation-based combination therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.",
40242216,CRISPR-dependent base editing as a therapeutic strategy for rare monogenic disorders.,Frontiers in genome editing (Front Genome Ed),"Rare monogenic disorders are caused by mutations in single genes and have an incidence rate of less
than 0.5%. Due to their low prevalence, these diseases often attract limited research and commercial
interest, leading to significant unmet medical needs. In a therapeutic landscape where treatments
are targeted to manage symptoms, gene editing therapy emerges as a promising approach to craft
curative and lasting treatments for these patients, often referred to as ""one-and-done""
therapeutics. CRISPR-dependent base editing enables the precise correction of genetic mutations by
direct modification of DNA bases without creating potentially deleterious DNA double-strand breaks.
Base editors combine a nickase version of Cas9 with cytosine or adenine deaminases to convert C·G to
T·A and A·T to G·C, respectively. Together, cytosine (CBE) and adenine (ABE) base editors can
theoretically correct ∼95% of pathogenic transition mutations cataloged in ClinVar. This mini-review
explores the application of base editing as a therapeutic approach for rare monogenic disorders. It
provides an overview of the state of gene therapies and a comprehensive compilation of preclinical
studies using base editing to treat rare monogenic disorders. Key considerations for designing base
editing-driven therapeutics are summarized in a user-friendly guide for researchers interested in
applying this technology to a specific rare monogenic disorder. Finally, we discuss the prospects
and challenges for bench-to-bedside translation of base editing therapies for rare monogenic
disorders.","CRISPR-based therapeutics, base editing, gene therapy, mutation correction, rare monogenic disease"
40225866,Integrating Single-Cell and Bulk RNA Sequencing Data to Explore Sphingolipid Metabolism Molecular Signatures in Ovarian Cancer Prognosis: an Original Study.,International journal of medical sciences (Int J Med Sci),"<b>Background:</b> Ovarian cancer (OC) is the deadliest malignant tumor in the female reproductive
system. Sphingolipid metabolism (SM) is crucial for cellular function and has been linked to OC
progression. Dysregulation of sphingolipid pathways contributes to tumor growth, chemoresistance,
and metastasis in OC. Currently, investigations into the relationship between sphingolipid-related
genes (SRGs) and OC prognosis in their initial stages. Our study aimed to develop a novel molecular
subtyping based on SRGs and construct a signature to predict the prognosis of patients with OC,
immune cell infiltration characteristics, and chemotherapy sensitivity. <b>Methods:</b> Bulk and
single-cell RNA-sequencing data of OC was analyzed primarily from the TCGA and GEO databases. The
gene set related to the sphingolipid pathway (hsa00600) was selected from the SM pathway, and the
enrichment of SRGs was analyzed in the annotated single-cell sequencing data. The Scanpy function
was used to score the gene features of each cell and further identify differentially expressed
genes. By intersecting with the genes most closely related to SM activity identified through
Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) based on bulk RNA sequencing data, and after
performing univariate COX, multivariate COX and LASSO regression, three SRGs were identified.
Subsequently, the SRGs-related prognostic signature was constructed. The analysis was further
extended to clinical feature correlation, GSEA, tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis and
chemotherapy sensitivity analysis. Finally, the expression and function of the key gene GBP5 in the
model were validated through <i>in vitro</i> experiments. <b>Results:</b> Compared to other sites,
SRG scores were highest in ascites, and among different cell types, SRG scores were highest in T
cells. By integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis, three SRGs (C5AR1, GBP5, and MARCHF3)
were ultimately selected to develop a prognostic model for SRGs. In this model, patients with higher
risk scores had shorter overall survival, which was validated in the testing cohort. Immune
infiltration analysis revealed that the risk score was negatively correlated with the abundance of
CD8+ T cell infiltration and positively correlated with the abundance of M2 macrophage infiltration.
Chemotherapy sensitivity analysis showed that the high-risk group exhibited increased resistance to
Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Sorafenib. <i>In vitro</i>, we demonstrated that knockdown of the
protective gene GBP5 in HEYA8 and SKOV3 cells enhanced cell viability, proliferation, and
invasiveness, reduced apoptosis, and increased IC50 values for chemotherapy drugs.
<b>Conclusion:</b> Our model effectively identifies high-risk patients and provides a reference for
prognosis prediction using SRG signature. Moreover, hub gene GBP5 acts as a tumor inhibitory factor
and regulates the chemosensitivity of oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, and sorafenib in OC.","Chemotherapy drug sensitivity, GBP5, Immune infiltration, Ovarian cancer, Sphingolipid metabolism"
40163809,"Efficacy of a Novel BCL-xL Degrader, DT2216, in Preclinical Models of JAK2-mutated Post-MPN AML.",Blood (Blood),"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that evolves from myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is known as post-
MPN AML. Current treatments don't significantly extend survival beyond 12 months. BCL-xL has been
found to be overexpressed in leucocytes from MPN patients, making it a potential therapeutic target.
We investigated the role of BCL-xL in post-MPN AML and tested the efficacy of DT2216, a platelet-
sparing BCL-xL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), in preclinical models of post-MPN AML. We
found that BCL2L1, the gene encoding BCL-xL, is expressed at higher levels in post-MPN AML patients
compared to those with de novo AML. Single-cell multi-omics analysis revealed that leukemia cells
harboring both MPN-driver and TP53 mutations exhibited higher BCL2L1 expression, elevated scores for
leukemia stem cell, megakaryocyte development, and erythroid progenitor than wild-type cells. BH3
profiling confirmed a strong dependence on BCL-xL in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 alone, or in
combination with standard AML/MPN therapies, effectively degraded BCL-xL, reduced the apoptotic
threshold, and induced apoptosis in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 effectively eliminated viable cells
in JAK2-mutant AML cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells
(iPSC-HPCs), primary samples, and reduced tumor burden in cell line-derived xenograft model in vivo
by degrading BCL-xL. DT2216, either as a single agent or in combination with azacytidine,
effectively inhibited the clonogenic potential of CD34+ leukemia cells from post-MPN AML patients.
In summary, our data indicate that the survival of post-MPN AML is BCL-xL dependent, and DT2216 may
offer therapeutic advantage in this high-risk leukemia subset with limited treatment options.",
40165206,CRISPR screens with trastuzumab emtansine in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines reveal new insights into drug resistance.,Breast cancer research : BCR (Breast Cancer Res),"Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that is an effective therapy for
HER2-positive breast cancer; however, its efficacy is limited by drug resistance. While multiple
mechanisms of resistance have been proposed, these are not yet well understood. Greater
understanding of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance could provide new combination strategies to
overcome resistance or predictive biomarkers to guide therapy.  We have conducted CRISPR/Cas9
functional genomics modifier screens in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines to allow for unbiased
discovery of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance genes. Whole-genome knockout screens were carried out
in MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 cells treated with T-DM1 and its payload cytotoxin DM1. Hits were
validated in secondary T-DM1 screens using a focused single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library and
subsequently by individual gene knockout.  The whole-genome CRISPR screens with T-DM1 and DM1
identified 599 genes as potential modifiers of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance. Of these, 17 genes
were significantly enriched and 3 genes depleted at P < 0.001 in either or both MDA-MB-361 and MDA-
MB-453 libraries in the secondary screens. Among the top hits, were known T-DM1 sensitivity genes
ERBB2 and SLC46A3, in addition to negative regulators of mTOR complex 1: TSC1 and TSC2. MDA-MB-453
clones with knockout of TSC1 or partial knockout of TSC2 were more resistant to T-DM1 than wild type
cells in competition growth assays and to T-DM1 and other HER2 targeting therapies (T-DXd, lapatinib
and neratinib) in growth inhibition assays, and had increased internalisation of T-DM1 at 6 h. T-DM1
and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus demonstrated synergistic activity at inhibiting cell proliferation
at multiple T-DM1 concentrations across four HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines.  Our CRISPR
screening approach with T-DM1 in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines identified genes not
previously implicated in T-DM1 sensitivity or resistance, including TSC1 and TSC2. These genes may
inform new strategies to enhance T-DM1 therapy in the clinic.","Antibody-drug conjugates, CRISPR/Cas9, Drug resistance, Functional genomics, HER2-positive breast cancer, T-DM1, TSC1, TSC2"

editing technologies, particularly for therapeutic applications. Engineered metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) have emerged as a promising class of inorganic nonviral vectors, offering unique advantages
such as tunable porosity, high cargo-loading capacity, and biocompatibility. This review explores
the design and application of MOF-based nanoplatforms tailored for the targeted delivery of
CRISPR/Cas9 components, aiming to enhance gene-editing precision and efficiency. By incorporating
stimuli-responsive linkers and bioactive ligands, these MOFs enable controlled release of
CRISPR/Cas9 payloads at the target site. Comparative discussions demonstrate superior performance of
MOFs over conventional nonviral systems in terms of stability, transfection efficiency, and reduced
off-target effects. Additionally, the intracellular trafficking mechanisms and the therapeutic
potential of these platforms in preclinical models are discussed. These findings highlight the
transformative potential of MOF-based delivery systems in overcoming the challenges associated with
gene-editing technologies, such as immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, paving the way for their
application in precision medicine. This review provides a blueprint for the integration of

40121237,MCL‑1 safeguards activated hair follicle stem cells to enable adult hair regeneration.,Nature communications (Nat Commun),"Hair follicles cycle through expansion, regression and quiescence. To investigate the role of MCL‑1,
a BCL‑2 family protein with anti‑apoptotic and apoptosis‑unrelated functions, we delete Mcl‑1 within
the skin epithelium using constitutive and inducible systems. Constitutive Mcl‑1 deletion does not
impair hair follicle organogenesis but leads to gradual hair loss and elimination of hair follicle
stem cells. Acute Mcl‑1 deletion rapidly depletes activated hair follicle stem cells and completely
blocks depilation‑induced hair regeneration in adult mice, while quiescent hair follicle stem cells
remain unaffected. Single‑cell RNA‑seq profiling reveals the engagement of P53 and DNA mismatch
repair signaling in hair follicle stem cells upon depilation‑induced activation. Trp53 deletion
rescues hair regeneration defects caused by acute Mcl‑1 deletion, highlighting a critical interplay
between P53 and MCL‑1 in balancing proliferation and death. The ERBB pathway plays a central role in
sustaining the survival of adult activated hair follicle stem cells by promoting MCL‑1 protein
expression. Remarkably, the loss of a single Bak allele, a pro‑apoptotic Bcl‑2 effector gene,
rescues Mcl‑1 deletion‑induced defects in both hair follicles and mammary glands. These findings
demonstrate the pivotal role of MCL‑1 in inhibiting proliferation stress‑induced apoptosis when
quiescent stem cells activate to fuel tissue regeneration.",

involvement markedly affecting prognosis. The mechanisms underlying the transition from compensation
to dysfunction in response to metabolic deficiency remain unclear. Here, we used spatially resolved
transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on the heart of a patient with
mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (MCM), combined with an MCM mouse model with cardiac-specific Ndufs6
knockdown (FS6KD). Cardiomyocytes demonstrated the most heterogeneous expression landscape among
cell types caused by metabolic perturbation, and pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed dynamic
cellular states transitioning from compensation to severe compromise. This progression coincided
with the transient up-regulation of a transcription factor, <i>ATF3</i>. Genetic ablation of
<i>Atf3</i> in FS6KD corroborated its pivotal role, effectively delaying cardiomyopathy progression
in a female-specific manner. Our findings highlight a fate-determining role of <i>ATF3</i> in female
MCM progression and that the latest transcriptomic analysis will help decipher the mechanisms
underlying MD progression.",
40241195,Drosophila architectural proteins M1BP and Opbp cooperatively form the active promoter of a ribosomal protein gene.,Epigenetics & chromatin (Epigenetics Chromatin),"In Drosophila, architectural proteins are frequently found in promoters, including those of genes
with extremely high expression levels, such as ribosomal protein genes (RPGs). The involvement of
several of these proteins in gene regulation in Drosophila has been shown, but the exact mechanisms
of their possible cooperative action have not been fully elucidated.  In this study we dissected the
contribution of the architectural proteins Opbp and M1BP, which are co-localized at several RPG
promoters near the transcription start site, to promoter functioning. We found that Opbp has two
domains that directly interact with CP190, Putzig (Pzg), and Chromator (Chro) proteins, the
cofactors which are required for the activation of housekeeping (hk) gene promoters. These domains
have redundant functions in vivo and can tether the cofactors forming open chromatin regions when
are artificially recruited to the ""closed"" chromatin. Additionally, we observed interactions between
M1BP and the same cofactors. In the transgene assay, the transcription driven by the 192-bp part of
Rpl27A RPG promoter is fully dependent on the presence of at least one Opbp or M1BP binding site and
it is sufficient for the very high activity of this promoter integrated into the hk gene cluster and
moderate expression outside the cluster, while presence of both sites even more facilitates
transcription.  This study demonstrates that different architectural proteins can work independently
and in cooperation and fulfill partially redundant functions in the activation of RPG promoters.","Architectural С2Н2 proteins, CP190, Chriz, Chro, Chromator, Housekeeping genes, Putzig, Ribosomal protein genes, Z4, Zinc-finger proteins"

potential for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe genetic disorder affecting approximately 1
in 5000 male births globally. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes a
critical membrane-associated protein essential for maintaining muscle structure, function and
repair. Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle degeneration, loss of ambulation,
respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac failure, with most succumbing to the disease by their third
decade of life. Despite the well-characterized genetic basis of DMD, curative treatments- such as
exon skipping therapies, micro-dystrophin, and steroids- remain elusive. Recent preclinical studies
have demonstrated the promise of CRISPR-based approaches in restoring dystrophin expression across
various models, including human cells, murine systems, and large animal models. These advancements
highlight the potential of gene editing to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the disease.
However, significant challenges persist, including immunogenicity, off-target effects, and limited
editing efficiency, which hinder clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis
of the latest developments in CRISPR-based therapeutic strategies for DMD. It emphasizes the need
for further innovation in gene-editing technologies, delivery systems, and rigorous safety

human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-microglia (iMG) could enable brain-wide and pathology-

the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin under control of the plaque-responsive promoter, CD9. To further
determine whether increased engraftment enhances efficacy, we utilized a CSF1R-inhibitor resistance
approach. Interestingly, both localized and brain-wide engraftment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice
reduced multiple biochemical measures of pathology. However, within the plaque-dense subiculum,
reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis and preservation of neuronal
density were only achieved following widespread microglial engraftment. Lastly, we examined chimeric
models of breast cancer brain metastases and demyelination, demonstrating that iMG adopt diverse
transcriptional responses to differing neuropathologies, which could be harnessed to enable

biosensing system on the electrochemical interface is vital for accurate and timely diagnosis in
clinical practice. Herein, an electrochemical biosensor based on manganese metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs)-enhanced CRISPR (MME-CRISPR) is proposed that enables the efficient detection of circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA). In this design, customized enzyme stimulants (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) are co-assembled
with Cas12a/crRNA to form enzyme-MOF composites, which can be released quickly under mild

afford efficient protection against various external stimulus. It is demonstrated that the developed
biosensor can achieve ultrasensitive detection of epidermal growth factor receptor L858R mutation in
ctDNA with a low detection limit of 0.28 fm without pre-amplification. Furthermore, the engineered

40121577,Cell death pathway regulation by fatty acid metabolism-related genes in neuroblastoma: a multi-omics analysis identifying CHD5 as a novel biomarker.,Discover oncology (Discov Oncol),"Neuroblastoma in children is commonly found as an extracranial solid tumor with poor prognosis in
high-risk cases impeding successful treatment. While dysregulated cell death mechanisms and
metabolic reprogramming are hallmarks of cancer progression, the interplay between fatty acid
metabolism and cell death pathway regulation in neuroblastoma remains incompletely understood.
Identifying molecular subtypes influenced by fatty acid metabolism were built by consensus
clustering analysis. Independent prognostic genes were identified through random survival forest
analysis, acquiring a novel risk signature. Risk signatures were validated internally and
externally, and their independent prognostic value, immune landscape, and drug susceptibility were
explored. The study systematically analyzed correlations between signature genes and seven major
cell death pathways (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, cuproptosis, and
disulfidptosis), encompassing over 1,200 genes to comprehensively explore the intricate
relationships between these molecular signatures and diverse cell death mechanisms. Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to assess pathway-level associations. Utilizing a single-
cell dataset of neuroblastoma samples, cells were categorized and labeled based on UMAP analysis.
Feature map visualization was employed to display the expression level and allocation of specific
genes across various cell populations. Validation of CHD5 expression in NB cells and tissues was
confirmed through Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining.  The study identified 42 fatty
acid metabolism key enzyme genes whose expression was significantly different within high-risk and
non-high-risk neuroblastoma patients, by which acquiring two distinct prognostic clusters associated
with fatty acid metabolism. A machine learning approach was used to select 4 hub genes (CHD5, TP63,
XKR4, and CTAG1A) for the establishment of a fatty acid metabolism prognostic risk model. Cell death
pathway analysis revealed that TP63 exhibited the strongest correlations across multiple death
pathways, particularly with necroptosis (r = 0.684, p = 2.80e-23) and pyroptosis (r = 0.647,
p = 3.12e-20), while XKR4 showed moderate correlations with autophagy (r = 0.398, p = 2.09e-07) and
CHD5 displayed selective associations. High risk score and low risk score groups displayed notable
variations in the immune microenvironment, characterized by reduced immune cell infiltration in the
high group leading to immune escape, and conversely, heightened responsiveness of the low group to
immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Single-cell dataset analysis highlighted significant expression
of CHD5 in specific cell populations, suggesting its potential as a marker gene for neuroblastoma.
Immunohistochemical staining revealed varying levels of CHD5 expression across different clinical
stages of neuroblastoma, with decreased deposition observed as staging advances. Functionally, CHD5
expression was found to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma cells.  The
developed fatty acid metabolism prognostic risk model underscores the significance of fatty acids in
neuroblastoma prognosis and immune landscape, thereby facilitating the optimization of chemotherapy
and immunotherapy strategies for this disease. The comprehensive analysis of cell death pathways
revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms of signature genes, particularly highlighting TP63's central
role in coordinating multiple cell death processes. CHD5, as an identified gene inhibiting the
proliferation, invasion and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells, serves as a novel tumor biomarker.","CHD5, Cell death, Fatty acid metabolism, Neuroblastoma, Prognostic model"
40241135,ADAR1-high tumor-associated macrophages induce drug resistance and are therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.,Molecular cancer (Mol Cancer),"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered the third most common type of cancer worldwide. Tumor-
associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote drug resistance. Adenosine-to-inosine RNA-
editing, as regulated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), is a process that induces the
posttranscriptional modification of critical oncogenes. The aim of this study is to determine
whether the signals from cancer cells would induce RNA-editing in macrophages.  The effects of RNA-
editing on phenotypes in macrophages were analyzed using clinical samples and in vitro and in vivo
models.  The intensity of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 (Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) in
cancer and mononuclear cells indicated a strong positive correlation between the nucleus and
cytoplasm. The ADAR1-positive mononuclear cells were positive for CD68 and CD163, a marker for M2
macrophages. Cancer cells transport pro-inflammatory cytokines or ADAR1 protein directly to
macrophages via the exosomes, promoting RNA-editing in AZIN1 (Antizyme Inhibitor 1) and GLI1
(Glioma-Associated Oncogene Homolog 1) and resulting in M2 macrophage polarization. GLI1 RNA-editing
in the macrophages induced by cancer cells promotes the secretion of SPP1, which is supplied to the
cancer cells. This activates the NFκB pathway in cancer cells, promoting oxaliplatin resistance.
When the JAK inhibitors were administered, oncogenic RNA-editing in the macrophages was suppressed.
This altered the macrophage polarization from M2 to M1 and decreased oxaliplatin resistance in
cancer cells.  This study revealed that ADAR1-high TAMs are crucial in regulating drug resistance in
CRC and that targeting ADAR1 in TAMs could be a promising treatment approach for overcoming drug
resistance in CRC.","Biomarker, Chemoresistance, Colorectal cancer, Macrophage, RNA-editing"

However, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) limit T cell persistence and durable
efficacy. Here, we aimed to identify and target immunosuppressive factors in the TME of
neuroblastoma, a pediatric extracranial solid tumor, to improve CAR-T efficacy.  Immunosuppressive
factors were identified using a multi-omics approach, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) of 24 neuroblastoma tumors, published bulk-RNA sequencing datasets, and mass-spectrometry of
patient-derived tumoroid models. Candidate targets were validated with functional assays in vitro
and in vivo. Protein degradation of the top immunosuppressive target by PROTAC technology was used
to evaluate the effect on CAR T-cell activity.  ScRNA-seq revealed 13 immunosuppressive interactions
in the TME of neuroblastoma, two effectors of which, Midkine (MDK) and Macrophage Migration
Inhibitory Factor (MIF), were validated as candidate targets across multiple published datasets.
Both factors were among the top 6 % of most abundantly secreted factors by patient-derived tumoroid
models, substantiating their potential relevance in the TME. In vitro and in vivo functional assays
confirmed MIF to be a potent inhibitor of CAR T-cell activation and killing capacity. To translate
these findings into a potentially clinically applicable treatment, we explored MIF targeting by
PROTAC technology, which significantly enhanced activation of CAR T-cells targeting GPC2 and B7-H3.
By defining the immunosuppressive effects of neuroblastoma's TME on CAR T-cell efficacy, revealing
the pivotal role of MIF, we provide an analytic pipeline and therapeutic strategy for improving
adoptive cell therapies for this pediatric malignancy and potentially other solid tumors.","CAR T-cell therapy, Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, MIF, Neuroblastoma, PROTAC"

cancer, posing a significant mortality and economic burden, especially in East and Southeast Asia.
Current therapeutic strategies have limitations in improving patient survival, particularly
regarding disease progression and resistance. This study aimed to investigate the impact of
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) on the ESCC microenvironment.  We utilized single-cell RNA
sequencing to systematically characterize the tumor and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
subtypes. Marker genes of myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) were employed to establish a prognostic
model and verify its application in other datasets. Other experiments were conducted on clinical
samples to explore potential ESCC risk-related genes.  Our bioinformatics and statistical analyses
revealed an increased proportion of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in NCRT and identified the
Ep_c1 subtype associated with a better prognosis. Further results indicated a complex communication
network between Ep_c1 and myCAFs. The top 30 marker genes of myCAFs were used to construct a
prognostic signature with a significant response to immunotherapy. Finally, experiments identified
Complement C1s subcomponent (C1S), Decorin (DCN), and Neuroblastoma suppression of tumorigenicity 1
(NBL1) as potential ESCC risk-related genes.  Our findings highlight the dynamic alterations in the
post-NCRT ESCC microenvironment and provide a foundation for the development of personalized

exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Among these, bacteriophage therapy has regained
attention as a promising approach to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophages are viruses
that infect and lyse specific bacterial strains, making them attractive candidates for targeted
antimicrobial treatment. Burkholderia multivorans, a Gram-negative bacterium, is known to cause
opportunistic infections, particularly in individuals with a compromised immune system or with
cystic fibrosis. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Burkholderia strains has raised concerns
about treatment options. In this study, we characterized the Burkholderia phage Bm1, a virulent
bacteriophage isolated from an environmental source. Electron microscopy revealed that Bm1 phage
particles have myovirus morphology, with an icosahedral head of 72 nm in diameter and a contractile
tail of 100 nm in length and 18 nm in width. The genome of phage Bm1 consists of a double-stranded
DNA of 67,539 bp with a terminal repeat region at each end. Comparative analysis indicated that the
closest relative of phage Bm1 is Burkholderia phage BCSR129, with a calculated VIRIDIC identity of

cells while cold-activated brown adipose tissue has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by disrupting
cancer cell metabolism. In a groundbreaking study published in Nature Biotechnology, Nguyen and
colleagues developed Adipose-Modified Therapy (AMT), a strategy that genetically reprograms white
adipocytes to outcompete tumors for key nutrients. Using CRISPR activation technology, researchers
enhanced adipocyte glucose and fatty acid consumption, by inducing a stable browning phenotype. In
vitro, browned adipocytes reduced glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in cancer cells, inhibiting
their proliferation. Implantation of engineered adipose organoids adjacent to tumors suppressed
tumor growth, reduced angiogenesis, and altered metabolic gene expression in xenograft models. AMT
also prevented tumor development in genetic mouse models of cancer, suggesting a role in cancer
prevention. Finally, modified human mammary adipocytes inhibited the growth of patient-derived
breast cancer organoids. This therapy, based on autologous fat transplantation, could offer a
reversible and patient-specific approach. Challenges remain, including metabolic plasticity in
cancer cells and the fragility of mature adipocytes in cell culture. AMT represents a paradigm shift
in cancer therapy, leveraging adipocytes as metabolic competitors rather than tumor facilitators,

work ( <i>1</i> ) here we present a versatile technology based on semi-permeable capsules (SPCs),
tailored for a variety of high-throughput nucleic acid assays, including digital PCR, genome
sequencing, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and FACS-based isolation of individual

precursor for microRNAs (miR)-424 and miR-503. However, studies have since demonstrated that
MIR503HG has distinct functions from its associated miRNAs, playing important roles in cell
proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and differentiation. While these miRNAs are known to influence
cardiomyocyte differentiation, the specific role of MIR503HG in heart development remains
unexplored. We seek to determine how MIR503HG deletion impacts ventricular chamber development and
to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.  To study the role of the lncRNA in vivo, we generated
a functional MIR503HG knockout mouse model (MIR503HG-/-) using a synthetic polyadenylation signal to
terminate MIR503HG transcription without affecting miR-424/503 expression. We performed
morphological analyses on embryonic and adult hearts using microCT along with cardiac functional
analysis via transthoracic echocardiography. We further apply single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-
seq) on adult hearts to identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes.
Functional deletion of MIR503HG alone was associated with reduced compact myocardium thickness and
increased trabecular myocardium in the left ventricle (LV) at embryonic day 17.5 compared to wild-
type mice, indicating a LV non-compaction (LVNC) phenotype. Moreover, adult MIR503HG-/- mutant
hearts showed increased trabecular complexity, impaired LV relaxation, and mitral valve
regurgitation. SnRNA-seq further revealed altered expression of several genes associated with
cardiomyocyte function and LVNC, including Actc1, Mib1, Mybpc3, and Myh7. Lastly, Notch1 activity
was also significantly increased in mutant hearts which has been previously associated with LVNC.
MIR503HG plays a role in ventricular chamber development, and its deletion leads to an LVNC
phenotype independent of the miRNA cluster within its locus, highlighting its importance in cardiac
development and disease. We further suggest that abnormal Notch1 activity may underpin the LVNC
phenotype presented.","Heart development, Left ventricular non-compaction, Long non-coding RNA"

during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established
using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4,
were conducted in vivo. CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated
with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell
overactivation.  CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced
cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells alleviates
myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of
CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The
transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in acute FM. In

was measured by novel object recognition and spontaneous alternation behavior tests. Hippocampal
neuronal function was assessed by measuring long-term potentiation (LTP) electrophysiology, the
synaptic correlate of learning and memory. Tau pathology was assessed by immunohistochemical
analyses and western blot assessment of pTau levels in CF mouse brain, as well as human nasal
epithelial cells isolated from pwCF.  Cognitive function declined progressively with age in Cftr

also deficient in older G542X mice. Increased pTau was observed by staining and western blot
analysis in the hippocampus of aged CF mice. Secondary impacts of tauopathy, including increased
microglial uptake of cholesterol and reduced neuronal density were also observed. Lastly, human
nasal epithelial cells from pwCF were found to display elevated pTau levels compared to non-CF

Among cultivated pears, fruits from
<i>Pyrus communis</i> (hereafter referred to as <i>P. communis</i>) cultivars are famous for their
abundant aroma, while the fruits of most <i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (hereafter referred to as <i>P.
pyrifolia</i>) cultivars lack aroma compounds. A comparative study on the formation of differential
aroma compounds between the two species could provide a theoretical foundation for improving the
aroma quality of <i>P. pyrifolia</i> cultivars. However, there is a lack of systematic research on
this subject.  An analysis of volatile and non-volatile metabolites was combined with transcriptome
analysis to explore the formation mechanism of differential aroma compounds between three <i>P.

compounds were identified in the six cultivars. Of these, sixteen ester and alcohol compounds,
including butyl acetate, hexyl acetate, ethyl-2-methylbutyrate, ethanol, butanol, propanol, and
2-methylbutanol, with higher contents in the <i>P. communis</i> cultivars than in the <i>P.

possible synthesis pathways for these 16 aroma compounds, certain amino acid degradation processes,
including isoleucine, valine, and alanine oxidation and threonine dehydration, were found to provide
important intermediate substances for synthesis. Within the key enzyme genes in the synthesis
pathway, several critical enzyme genes, including monoacylglycerol lipase (PcMAGL, pycom08g09340),
threonine dehydrase (PcTD, pycom12g10020), and acyl CoA dehydrogenase (PcACD, pycom16g13880), might

the cardiac fibrosis phenotype in diabetic mice and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.  A
streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model was used in the experiments. After successful induction
of diabetes, the mice received propionate treatment. Cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory factor levels
were assessed using histological analysis and biochemical assays. Furthermore, single-cell RNA
sequencing and primary mouse cardiac fibroblast sequencing data were analyzed to explore the
potential mechanisms underlying propionate's effects on diabetic cardiac fibrosis. Finally, the
molecular mechanism by which propionate reverses diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis was validated
using shRNA knockdown experiments.  The results showed that propionate treatment significantly
improved cardiac fibrosis in diabetic mice and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in cardiac
tissues. Additionally, propionate upregulated the expression of the Serpinf1 gene, inhibited the
abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, and reduced fibrosis and marker expression levels
in high-glucose-induced cardiac fibroblasts.  The main conclusion of this study is that propionate
effectively improves the diabetic cardiac fibrosis phenotype in mice, and this therapeutic effect is

Despite advances in treatment, high-risk neuroblastoma remains difficult to manage due to its
heterogeneous nature and frequent development of drug resistance. Drug repurposing guided by single-

characterize high-risk neuroblastoma subpopulations and identify effective repurposed drugs for
targeted treatment. We performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of neuroblastoma samples,
integrating bulk RNA-seq data deconvolution with clinical outcomes to define distinct malignant cell
states. Using a systematic drug repurposing pipeline, we identified and validated potential
therapeutic agents targeting specific high-risk neuroblastoma subpopulations. Single-cell analysis
revealed 17 transcriptionally distinct neuroblastoma subpopulations. Survival analysis identified a
highly aggressive subpopulation characterized by elevated UBE2C/PTTG1 expression and poor patient
outcomes, distinct from a less aggressive subpopulation with favorable prognosis. Drug repurposing
screening identified Adavosertib as particularly effective against the aggressive subpopulation,
validated using SK-N-DZ cells as a representative model. Mechanistically, Adavosertib suppressed
cell proliferation through AKT/mTOR pathway disruption, induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and
promoted apoptosis. Further analysis revealed UBE2C and PTTG1 as key molecular drivers of drug
resistance, where their overexpression enhanced proliferation, Adavosertib resistance, and cell
migration. This study establishes a single-cell-based drug repurposing strategy for high-risk

progression. To better understand these mechanisms and pathways, extensive in-depth research on cell
cycle-related genes is necessary. This review aims to describe and interpret current single-cell RNA
sequencing studies on neuroblastoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and pheochromocytoma tumors. Our
review summarizes differentially expressed cell cycle-related genes with distinct functions,
highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets and components of panels used to determine tumor
type or aggressiveness. Although some insights have been gained, there is still limited information
on these topics, and further research is required to explore the regulatory mechanisms of these
tumors.","Adrenal gland, Cell cycle-related genes, Medullary thyroid cancer, Neuroblastoma, Neuroendocrine tumors, Pheochromocytoma, Thyroid gland, scRNA-seq"
40212811,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the heterogeneity and regulatory modules of cell-specific RNA-binding proteins in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,Biochemistry and biophysics reports (Biochem Biophys Rep),"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by immune dysregulation,
heterogeneous clinical phenotypes, and a complex interplay of pathogenic mechanisms. RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs), which orchestrate post-transcriptional gene regulation through dynamic interactions
with target transcripts, are increasingly implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. However, the cell-
type-specific heterogeneity of RBPs expression and their regulatory networks in SLE remain poorly
characterized.  To delineate RBPs dynamics in SLE skin microenvironment, we conducted a
comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of publicly accessible single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) datasets from lesional skin biopsies of SLE patients and healthy controls (HC). Cell-
type-specific RBPs expression patterns were systematically profiled across epidermal keratinocytes,
dermal endothelial cells, and T cells. Complementary bulk RNA-Seq analyses employing Splicing Site
Usage Variation Analysis (SUVA) were performed to identify immune gene-associated regulatory
alternative splicing (RAS) events. Integrative co-expression networks linking RBPs, RAS events, and
immune pathways were subsequently constructed.  Single-cell resolution revealed marked heterogeneity
in RBPs expression across keratinocyte, endothelial cell, and T cell in SLE compared to HC. Notably,
disease-specific RBPs were enriched in pathways governing interferon response, cytokine signaling,
and leukocyte activation. Cross-analysis with bulk transcriptomic data highlighted JUN and HLA-A as
hub regulators exhibiting elevated expression in SLE T cells. Network modeling further uncovered
coordinated interactions between JUN, HLA-A, and RAS events in immune genes, implicating their
synergistic roles in modulating T cell effector functions.  Our multi-omics integration identifies
JUN and HLA-A as central coordinators of alternative splicing programs in SLE T cells. These
molecular hubs, embedded within immune regulatory networks, may drive pathogenic rewiring of T cell
responses in SLE.","HLA-A, JUN, RNA-Binding proteins, Systemic lupus erythematosus, single cell RNA-Sequencing"
40230848,The role of transketolase in the immunotherapy and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a multi-omics approach.,Frontiers in immunology (Front Immunol),"To explore the role of transketolase (TKT) in the immunotherapy and prognosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).  TKT expression across various cancers and its associations with tumor immunity and
prognosis were analyzed using nomogram models. A multi-omics approach was employed, including bulk
RNA-seq analysis, methylation profiling, single-cell analysis, and spatial transcriptomics.
Experimental methods included RT-qPCR, siRNA transfection, luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation.  TKT was significantly upregulated in multiple cancers and correlated with
immune cell infiltration, particularly in HCC. Elevated TKT expression was associated with poor
overall survival (OS) in HCC and was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05). Drug sensitivity
analysis suggested that higher TKT expression was associated with reduced sensitivity to several
chemotherapeutic agents, including sorafenib (p < 0.01). Furthermore, hypermethylation of the TKT
promoter and low TKT expression were linked to improved OS in HCC (log-rank test p = 0.005). Single-
cell analysis revealed that TKT was predominantly expressed in the monocyte/macrophage cluster
associated with HCC, and pseudo-time series analysis highlighted TKT's role in cell differentiation
within this cluster. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the close association between TKT and
macrophage distribution in HCC. Moreover, STAT3 was found to directly regulate TKT expression by
binding to its promoter region.  Our findings suggest that TKT may play a role in tumor immunity and
prognosis in HCC. Although these results provide insights into the potential involvement of TKT in
immune cell infiltration and survival outcomes, further studies are required to fully elucidate its
role in immunotherapy.","Hep-G2, TKT, hepatocellular carcinoma, pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase"
40201592,Modulation of cell fate by shock wave therapy in ischaemic heart disease.,European heart journal open (Eur Heart J Open),"Cardiac shockwave therapy (SWT) improves left ventricular (LV) function in patients with ischaemic
cardiomyopathy. Shockwave therapy activates Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a receptor-inducing
chromatin remodelling and nuclear reprogramming of cardiac cells. We hypothesized that mechanical
activation of TLR3 facilitates reprogramming of fibroblasts towards endothelial cells restoring
myocardial perfusion and function.  Human cardiac fibroblasts were treated by mechanical stimulation
via SWT or TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) in the presence of endothelial induction medium. A lineage tracing
experiment was performed in a transgenic mouse model of Fsp1-Cre/LacZ mice after coronary occlusion.
Left ventricular function and scarring were assessed. Single-cell sequencing including RNA
trajectory analysis was performed. Chromatin remodelling and epigenetic plasticity were evaluated
via western blot and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing. Mechanical stimulation
of human fibroblasts with SWT activated TLR3 signalling and enhanced the expression of endothelial
genes in a TLR3-dependent fashion. The induced endothelial cells (ECs) resembled genuine ECs in that
they produced endothelial nitric oxide and formed tube-like structures in Matrigel. In a lineage
tracing experiment in Fsp1-Cre/LacZ mice, shockwave treatment increased LacZ/CD31-positive cells
(indicating transdifferentiation) after coronary occlusion. Furthermore, SWT reduced myocardial scar
size and improved LV function. Single-cell RNA-seq and RNA trajectory analyses revealed that SWT
induced an endothelial fibroblast cluster and mechanical stimulation induced significant changes in
chromatin organization, with chromatin being more accessible after both treatments in 1705 genomic
regions.  Shockwave therapy enhances DNA accessibility via TLR3 activation and facilitates the
transdifferentiation of fibroblasts towards endothelial cells in ischaemic myocardium.","Cardiac surgery, Heart regeneration, Shockwave therapy, Therapeutic transdifferentiation"
40217309,Decoding mitochondrial stress genes in DCM: towards precision diagnosis and therapy.,Hereditas (Hereditas),"Mitochondrial oxidative stress (ROS) is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM). Despite its significance, robust biomarkers for assessing its role remain
scarce. This study investigates ROS mechanisms in DCM and identifies associated biomarkers, offering
fresh insights into diagnosis and treatment.  We sourced transcriptomic data from the GEO database
and mitochondrial oxidative stress-related genes from GeneCards. Using consensus clustering, we
identified 64 genes associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress in DCM and further isolated five
hub genes through protein-protein interaction and machine learning techniques. These genes were
analyzed for functions related to immunity, drug sensitivity, and single-cell localization.
Concurrently, we collected blood samples from DCM patients to validate the hub genes' expression.
The study identified five hub genes related to mitochondrial oxidative stress: VCL, ABCB1, JAK2,
KDR, and NGF. Expression analysis revealed high levels of VCL, ABCB1, KDR, and NGF in the non-
failing (NF) group, while JAK2 was elevated in the DCM group (p < 0.05). Diagnostic efficacy,
measured by area under the curve (AUC), was significant for VCL (76.4), ABCB1 (80.1), JAK2 (68.2),
KDR (78.1), and NGF (71.8). Moreover, several drugs were identified as potential regulators of these
hub genes, including Topotecan, CDK9_5576, Acetalax, Afatinib, and GSK591. Notably, VCL showed
increased expression in DCM patient blood samples, consistent with transcriptomic and single-cell
findings.  This research highlights key genes associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress-VCL,
ABCB1, JAK2, KDR, NGF-that show differential expression in DCM and myocardial infarction. These
findings underscore their diagnostic potential and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies.","Bioinformatics, Diagnosis, Dilated cardiomyopathy, Immune infiltration, Mitochondria, Oxidative stress"
39849194,Comprehensive assessment of the significance of cellular senescence-associated genes in neuroblastoma.,Genes & genomics (Genes Genomics),"The clinical course of high-risk neuroblastoma patients remains suboptimal, and the dynamic and
reversible nature of cellular senescence provides an opportunity to develop new therapies.  This
study aims to identify unique markers of cellular senescence in neuroblastoma and to explore their
clinical significance.  The impact of multiple genetic regulatory mechanisms on cellular senescence-
associated genes (CSAGs) was first assessed. We identified cellular senescence-associated subtypes
by hierarchical clustering and explored the intrinsic differences between subtypes. We screened key
CSAGs based on PPI networks and clinical significance. Subsequently, we constructed the cellular
senescence-related risk score (CSRS) by LASSO regression and stepwise Cox regression, and validated
its performance and stability through multiple methods. Finally, we performed single-cell analysis
and constructed the nomogram.  The expression of CSAGs was influenced by copy number variation and
DNA methylation. We found that significant differences between cellular senescence-associated
subtypes in immune infiltration and overall prognosis. AURKA, CDK4, TERT were key genes in the
cellular senescence process. CSRS showed superior and robust predictive performance in several
cohorts and could serve as an independent prognostic factor in neuroblastoma. The senescence
signature was also meaningful at the single-cell level and the nomogram was shown to have high
accuracy and high clinical benefit.  We comprehensively evaluated the significance of cellular
senescence in neuroblastoma and concluded that it was significantly associated with immune
characteristics and overall prognosis. Based on the expression levels of CSAGs, we developed the
CSRS, which was a reliable tool to contribute to prognostic assessment and clinical decision making.","Cellular senescence, Hierarchical clustering, Immune, Neuroblastoma, Risk score, scRNA-seq"
40241265,Allelic value in gene regulation - implications for gene editing.,Annals of botany (Ann Bot),"Gene editing has emerged as the most precise trait modification tool in plant breeding. However, an
understanding of what to target and in which genetic background to obtain the intended phenotype is
still emerging. This perspective presents an analytical overview of traits targeted, particularly in
tomato and rice, where extensive data on gene editing is available in the public domain.  The
available gene editing data on allelic values for a given molecular pathway in crops like tomato and
rice is revisited. The phenotypes of edits generated across genetic backgrounds were assessed and
compared with available resequencing and phenotypic data. The traits evaluated in the current
perspective were de novo domestication, grain quality, fruit color, yield-related traits and stress
tolerance to check whether the data available gives significant leads to address these traits via
editing in other crops. The rationale for editing a particular gene lies in the understanding of the
diverse alleles generated, and in this perspective, we attempted to discern both the advancements
made and the bottlenecks encountered.  The effectiveness of gene editing relies significantly on the
roles of alleles generated in regulating specific genetic pathways. It is essential to conduct
functional validation of the targeted allele across multiple distinct genetic backgrounds to
ascertain its utility. The influence an allele exerts on a given trait is contingent upon factors
like the nature of the trait, the position of the gene within a given pathway, and the genetic
background in which it has been/will be tested. This perspective highlights how editing has led to a
range of phenotypic variations influenced by the genetic background, with certain lines achieving
the desired phenotype alongside pleiotropic effects, whereas others do not manifest the expected
phenotype. This challenge may be addressed by prioritizing the identification of the right candidate
and specific motifs in the regulatory regions as potential targets rather than directly intervening
in coding sequences.","alleles, genetic background, phenotype, rice, tomato, trait"
40233268,"Single-cell RNA Sequencing Contributes to the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia With Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Chemotherapy, and Immunotherapy.",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology (J Biochem Mol Toxicol),"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by altered maturation and differentiation of myeloid blasts,
as well as transcriptional/epigenetic alterations and impaired apoptosis, all of which lead to
excessive proliferation of malignant blood cells in the bone marrow. It is these mutations that
cause tumor heterogeneity, which is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML
treatments like HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer
vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible to find
cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for
better AML management. The HSCT process works better when genetic and transcriptional information
about the patient and donor stem cells is collected. This saves time and lowers the risk of harmful
side effects happening in the body.","RNA sequencing, cancer vaccine, drug resistance, stem cell transplantation, transcriptome, tumor heterogeneity"
40240556,Quantitative MRI detects delayed perfusion and impact of bronchial artery dilatation on pulmonary circulation in patients with cystic fibrosis.,European radiology (Eur Radiol),"MRI detects abnormal lung perfusion in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, little is known
about the contribution of bronchial arteries to lung perfusion in CF. We hypothesized that delayed
perfusion can be detected by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-)MRI and that bronchial artery
dilatation (BAD) is associated with changes in lung perfusion.  Morpho-functional MRI was
prospectively acquired in 75 patients with CF (18.7 ± 7.6 years, range 6-39 years). Lungs and
perfusion defects were segmented automatically to quantify perfusion defects in percent (QDP).
Pulmonary blood flow (PBF), mean transit time (MTT), and perfusion delay were calculated for the
whole lung, inside normally perfused and perfusion defect areas. Chest MRI score and BAD were
assessed visually.  QDP and PBF correlated with MRI global score (r = 0.58 and -0.53, p < 0.001). In
normally perfused lung, PBF was higher (161.2 ± 77.9 mL/100 mL/min vs. 57.5 ± 26.4 mL/100 mL/min,
p < 0.001), and MTT (5.4 ± 1.7 s vs. 6.9 ± 2.3 s, p < 0.001) and perfusion delay were shorter than
in perfusion defect areas (4.6 ± 5.3 s vs. 13.4 ± 16.2 s, p < 0.001). 48 (64.0%) patients showed
BAD, had higher QDP (44.6 ± 20.8% vs. 17.3 ± 11.0%, p < 0.001) and lower PBF
(91.9 ± 54.8 mL/100 mL/min vs. 178.3 ± 77.4 mL/100 mL/min, p < 0.001) than patients without BAD. MTT
was shorter (6.3 ± 1.9 s vs. 8.0 ± 2.6 s, p < 0.001), and perfusion delay was longer (13.8 ± 10.1 s
vs. 12.8 ± 23.7 s, p < 0.02) inside perfusion defects of patients with BAD compared to without BAD.
Perfusion parameters correlate with lung disease severity, and perfusion defects showed delayed
perfusion in patients with CF. BAD was associated with more extensive perfusion defects and reduced
PBF.  Question Dilated bronchial arteries are a common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), which
can cause hemoptysis, but their quantitative contribution to lung perfusion is little researched.
Findings Perfusion defects in percent (QDP) enabled objective assessment of perfusion abnormalities
in CF patients, while perfusion delay and arterial correlation showed bronchial artery perfusion
contribution. Clinical relevance The usage of quantitative perfusion metrics in CF may help tracking
disease progression. By also including the proposed metrics perfusion delay and arterial
correlation, bronchial artery inflow could be assessed and used to detect early onset of bronchial
artery dilation.","Bronchial arteries, Cystic fibrosis, Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, Hemoptysis, Magnetic resonance imaging"

as histochemical markers of neurons in the nervous system. Secretagogin is a member of ""neuron-

neuronal activity remain ambiguous. We aimed to fill this gap of knowledge both in its use as a cell
identity marker and for mechanistic analysis.  We mapped secretagogin distribution in human foetal
forebrains. Then, Scgn-iCre::Ai9 mice in conjunction with single-cell RNA-seq were used to
molecularly characterize cortical secretagogin-expressing neurons. Besides the in vitro manipulation
of both SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical cultures from foetal mice, the activity
dependence of secretagogin expression was also studied upon systemic kainate administration and dark
rearing.  In the mammalian brain, including humans, both transient and stable secretagogin
expression sites exist. In the cerebral cortex, we identified deep-layer pyramidal neurons with
lifelong expression of secretagogin. Secretagogin expression was affected by neuronal activity: it
was delayed in a cohort of human foetuses with Down's syndrome relative to age-matched controls. In
mice, dark rearing reduced secretagogin expression in the superior colliculus, a midbrain structure
whose development is dependent on topographic visual inputs. In contrast, excitation by both KCl
exposure of SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons in vitro and through systemic kainate
administration in mice increased secretagogin expression.  We suggest that secretagogin expression
in neurons is developmentally regulated and activity dependent.","calcium‐binding protein, light deprivation, neurodevelopmental disorder, single‐cell transcriptomics, trisomy"
40223063,Prognostic value of natural killer T cell related genes in acute myeloid leukemia.,Cancer cell international (Cancer Cell Int),"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by complex immune
microenvironment. This study aims to identify immune-related prognostic biomarkers in AML.  Multiple
public sequencing datasets were utilized to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AML.
Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis
(WGCNA) were also performed. Immune cell infiltration was assessed at the single-cell level. NKT
cell marker genes were intersected with the most AML-relevant module genes to identify key genes.
Prognostic genes were screened using the Cox Lasso regression model, and their prognostic value was
evaluated with Cox random forest and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Gene expression was validated
using RT-qPCR and Western blot, and immune cell levels were analyzed by flow cytometry.  A total of
1,919 common DEGs were obtained between AML and controls. WGCNA revealed that the brown module was
most strongly associated with AML. Single-cell analysis showed that NKT cell infiltration was
significantly reduced in AML patients, consistent with ssGSEA results. Forty intersecting genes were
identified between NKT cell marker genes and brown module genes. Cox Lasso regression identified 10
prognostic genes (FGFBP2, GZMB, GZMH, IKZF3, IL2RB, KLRB1, KLRC2, RHOF, RUNX3, and STAT4). A risk
score model based on these genes stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with
significant differences in survival prognosis between the two groups. RT-qPCR and Western blot
analyses showed that these genes were significantly downregulated in AML patients. Flow cytometry
results revealed significantly lower levels of NKT and CD8 + T cells in AML patients compared to
controls.  This study identified key prognostic genes in AML and highlighted the critical role of
NKT cells in AML pathogenesis. The study provides new insights and potential biomarkers for
understanding AML biology, prognosis, and therapeutic targets.","Acute myeloid leukemia, NKT cell, Prognosis, WGCNA"
40208371,Identification and validation of pyroptosis patterns in AML via comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.,Discover oncology (Discov Oncol),"Pyroptosis, a lytic inflammatory cell death mechanism, plays dual roles in tumorigenesis, but its
clinical relevance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poorly understood. Through an integrative
analysis of 40 pyroptosis-related genes in newly diagnosed AML patients (TCGA, n = 151) and healthy
controls (GTEx, n = 386), we identified 32 genes with aberrant expression. Among these, 9 genes were
found to be significant prognostic markers, including ELANE (protective), and CASP1, CHMP4B, BAK1,
and CHMP2A (risk), which retained their prognostic significance after adjusting for age and gender.
Using unsupervised nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) on TCGA data, we classified AML into two
pyroptosis patterns: the ELANE<sup>high</sup> subtype, associated with favorable survival, and the
ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype, which was enriched in poor karyotypes and adverse outcomes. This
classification was validated in an independent cohort (GSE10358, n = 91). Single-cell RNA sequencing
data (GSE116256, n = 15) revealed that the ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype is characterized by an
immunologically active microenvironment, marked by an expansion of cytotoxic T cells and naive
CD4 + /CD8 + T cells. Factor analysis revealed associations between pyroptosis patterns and other
forms of cell death, including ferroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as with karyotype,
leukemia stemness, and TP53/FLT3-ITD mutations. Prognostic immune gene sets enriched in the
ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype were associated with interferon signaling and ubiquitin-mediated
degradation pathways. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified
three sub-networks and nine key hub genes. This study integrates gene expression data from newly
diagnosed AML patients, revealing the heterogeneity of pyroptosis patterns within the population. It
highlights the potential links between distinct pyroptosis patterns, the immune microenvironment,

functions of human monocyte-derived macrophages, including their interplay with significant human
pathogens such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Compared to other immortalized cell lines
of myeloid origin, THP-1 cells retain many intact inflammatory signaling pathways and display
phenotypic characteristics that more closely resemble those of primary monocytes, including the
ability to differentiate into macrophages when treated with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).
The use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to engineer THP-1 cells through targeted gene knockout (KO)
provides a powerful approach to better characterize immune-related mechanisms, including virus-host
interactions. This article describes a protocol for efficient CRISPR-Cas9-based engineering using
electroporation to deliver pre-assembled Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoproteins into the cell nucleus. Using
multiple sgRNAs targeting the same locus at slightly different positions results in the deletion of
large DNA fragments, thereby increasing editing efficiency, as assessed by the T7 endonuclease I
assay. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing at the genetic level was validated by Sanger sequencing followed
by Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) analysis. Protein depletion was confirmed by immunoblotting
coupled with a functional assay. Using this protocol, up to 100% indels in the targeted locus and a
decrease of over 95% in protein expression were achieved. The high editing efficiency makes it
convenient to isolate single-cell clones by limiting dilution.",

immune microenvironment of RA by exploring the cytokine secretion and expression of co-stimulatory
factors of RA synovial fibroblasts.  The Bulk RNA-seq dataset (GSE89408, Normal = 23, RA = 150) was
utilized for cytokine screening and the immune state assessment based on disease stage. RNA-seq was
employed to investigate cytokine and co-stimulatory molecule expression following 6 h of acid
stimulation, combined with Bulk RNA-seq data to evaluate contributions to RA. Human cytokine arrays
were used to confirm cytokine accumulation in supernatants after 12 h of acid stimulation.
Proteomics was applied to explore cellular functional states in RASFs under 6 h of acid stress, with
joint RNA-seq analysis elucidating transcription factor activation. Validation of select high-
throughput data was performed using qRT-PCR and immune-based assays.  Bulk RNA-seq and RNA-seq
identified 56 differentially expressed cytokines at their intersection. Functional enrichment
analysis demonstrated that acid stimulation enhanced cytokine secretion and T cell chemotaxis in RA
synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Cytokine array revealed that acid exposure increased the accumulation
of growth factors (e.g., FGF, VEGF) by over twofold and promoted the expression of multiple
inflammatory and chemotactic factors. Immune state analysis indicated that acid stimulation induced
a complex immune landscape by upregulating co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules.
Proteomics showed that acid stress enhanced mitochondrial function and triggered metabolic
